#  Inventory Management System (Console-based)

This is a simple Python script to manage and update inventory using the `Counter` class from Python's `collections` module.

It tracks the sales and restocking of two items: **Apples** and **Bananas**.

## Features

- Inventory tracking using Python dictionaries
- Sales input with inventory validation
- Dynamic restocking
- Real-time updates to inventory

##  How it Works

1. The program initializes an inventory with a fixed number of Apples and Bananas.
2. It takes user input for the quantity of each item sold.
3. If enough inventory is available, the sales are processed.
4. Inventory is updated after the sale.
5. The user is optionally prompted to restock items.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
python Inventory_management.py
